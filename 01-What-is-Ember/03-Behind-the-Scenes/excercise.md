Instructions
============ 

Create your own Handlebars template. Start at line 18 in the HTML file.

Hint
----

The template should look like this:

    <script type="text/x-handlebars">
         Some HTML in here
    </script>

You can use whatever markup you like, as long as you enclose it in the `script` tags.
