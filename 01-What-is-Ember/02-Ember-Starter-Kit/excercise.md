Instructions
============

Just read the code and the comments and try to figure out what should happen when our application will start. Then go to the JavaScript tab, uncomment the only line of code you'll find and Submit.
Hint
------

You only need to uncomment the last line of JavaScript so that the method:

    Ember.Application.create()

will be invoked.
