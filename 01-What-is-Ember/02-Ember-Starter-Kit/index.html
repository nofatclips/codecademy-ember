    <!-- 1. HANDLEBARS
    
    This is a Handlebars template. A template is like a
    mold: it allows you to create pieces of HTML that you
    can paste around your web page. In this case, the
    template will always print the same "Welcome" message,
    to keep it simple. Handlebars is the name of the format
    as well as the library that takes your template and
    turns it into HTML: again, in this case we only have
    pure HTML for the sake of simplicity, but you can
    easily imagine that we'd like to print our name instead
    of the word "Codecademian". We'll get there soon.
    
    P.S. Feel free to edit the HTML inside, but leave the
    script tags alone! (Have you noticed that the type is
    not JavaScript?)
    
    -->
    
    <script type="text/x-handlebars">
        <h2>Hello Codecademian, and Welcome to Ember</h2>
    </script>

    Nothing to watch here...

    Waiting for Ember application to start...

    <!-- 3. DEPENDENCIES
    
    Ember.js is an ambitious library to build ambitious
    applications, therefore it requires several libraries
    itself in order to work. We're importing a recent
    version of jQuery, Handlebars which you've already
    met, then Ember itself and finally our very own
    little application.
    The order is important here: Ember won't work without
    jQuery or Handlebars.
    Usually, Ember is also accompanied by Ember Data, a
    separate library to handle data models, but we'll deal
    with it later.
