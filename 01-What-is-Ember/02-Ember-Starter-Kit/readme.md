The Ember Starter Kit
=====================

The code you see in the HTML panel is a simplified version of the [Ember Starter Kit](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit) which you can grab to kickstart your own app when you'll feel confident to do so.

It has the minimal amount of code you need to create a functional Ember application.

I've added a couple of comments to explain the parts of the code that might look unfamiliar. Notice that our application hasn't started yet. The reason for that is that we haven't created the application.
