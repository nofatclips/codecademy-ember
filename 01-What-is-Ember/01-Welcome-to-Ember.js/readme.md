Welcome to Ember.js
===================

Hello fellow Codecademian!

What you're about to take is a short course about the basics of [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and its main components.

What is Ember.js, you might ask? Ember is a MVC framework for creating ambitious web applications. Ambitious as in: we'd like to do everything we normally do in desktop application. Ember is not there yet, but it's very promising.

MVC stands for [Model View Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller), an architectural pattern named after the three main components that made up applications built following this design technique. I'm not going to explain MVC in general right now.

While Ember.js was generally harder at the beginning when compared to other frameworks, this changed with the latest versions; also, once you made yourself familiar with a couple of important concepts you're in for many treats.
