[[Welcome to Ember.js]]

Hello fellow Codecademian!

What you're about to take is a short course about the basics of [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and its main components.

What is Ember.js, you might ask? Ember is a framework for creating ambitious web applications. Ambitious as in: we'd like to do everything we normally do in desktop application. Ember is not there yet, but it's very promising.

While Ember.js is generally harder at the beginning when compared to other frameworks, once you made yourself familiar with a couple of important concepts you're in for many treats.
