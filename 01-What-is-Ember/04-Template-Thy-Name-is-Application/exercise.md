Instructions
============

Let's give the second template a name of our choice: anything will do. Can you guess what is gonna happen? The first one will become the main template and will be shown again in the web page.

If you like it more explicit, you can also add the name `application` to the main template.

Hint
----

Your template should look like:

    <!-- Create your own Handlebars template here -->
    <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="my-template">
        whatever you typed here
    </script>
