Instructions
============

Let's give the second template a name of our choice: anything will do. Can you guess what is gonna happen? The first one will become the application template and will be shown again in the web page.
Hint
----

Your template should look like:

    <!-- Create your own Handlebars template here -->
    <script type="text/x-handlebars" data-template-name="my-template">
        whatever you typed here
    </script>
